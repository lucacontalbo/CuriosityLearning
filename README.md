# CuriosityLearning
Project work for the Unibo Artificial Intelligence course of Autonomous and Adaptive Systems

# Aim of the Project
The goal is to analyze the convergence speed of the agent for the Frozen Lake environment, using different approaches like MonteCarlo or Sarsa algorithms and by using different policy stategies (random or epsilon-greedy).  
We further analyze the performance and convergence speed of methods based on **curiosity learning**, i.e. learning with a reward function which is indicates how much the agent is surprised to be in a certain state. We show that, by using DQNs, noisy TVs can be a problem for learning based on curiosity, but they can also replicate the original reward function if the random noise is applied in specific states.
